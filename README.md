# 🛠️ Features
## Three floors, each with a separate router:

* First Floor: VLANs 10 (Enquiry), 20 (Sales/Marketing), 30 (Employee Dept)

* Second Floor: VLANs 40 (HR Dept), 50 (Finance Dept), 60 (Maintenance Dept)

* Third Floor: VLANs 70 (IT Dept), 80 (Admin Dept)

## Inter-VLAN Routing via routers.

## Wireless Access Points deployed on each floor for mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops).

## DHCP servers dynamically assigning IP addresses to devices.

## SSH Access for remote router management.

## Printer Integration in each department.

## Ping Tests verifying network connectivity between devices and across VLANs.

# 📈 Network Topology
Each floor has:

* A dedicated router (2811 series)

* A switch (2960 series)

* VLAN segmentation

* Wired and wireless client devices

* Printers connected to corresponding VLANs

* Backbone connections (red lines) interconnect routers across floors for seamless communication.

# 🚀 How to Use
Open Cisco Packet Tracer (Version 8.2.2 or above recommended).

Load the project file:
File -> Open -> BuildingNetwork.pkt

Explore the logical layout, VLAN configurations, router settings, DHCP setup, and wireless network integration.

Perform ping tests, SSH into routers, and try modifying the network to suit different requirements.

# 🔒 Security
SSH is configured on routers for secure management.

VLANs isolate traffic between departments, increasing security.
